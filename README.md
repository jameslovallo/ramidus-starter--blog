# Ramidus Blog Starter

This template is built with [Ramidus](https://ardi.netlify.app/ramidus) and is configured to work with [Tina CMS](https://tina.io).

```sh
npx ramidus@latest --starter blog
```

## Configuration

Posts generated by Tina are saved as Markdown in the `@/posts` folder. Images from Tina's media library are stored and served from `@/posts/media`. At build time, `@/blog.js` runs and generates the static html files inside the `/blog` folder, as well as the `@/posts/index.js` file. The `/blog` page uses `@/components/blog-posts.js` to read the posts from the index and handle filtering, sorting and pagination.
