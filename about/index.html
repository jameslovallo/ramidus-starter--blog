    <p>
      Hi, my name is James Lovallo. I am a web developer at Thrivent Financial
      and I enjoy building things with custom elements on my free time. Custom
      elements and ES Modules are the future of the platform. I built Ardi and
      Ramidus to make working with custom elements fun, easy, and accessible.
